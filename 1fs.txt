I don't belong here, we gotta move on, dear
Escape from this afterlife
'Cause this time I'm right to move on and on
Far away from here
Got nothing against you and surely I'll miss you
This place full of peace and light
And I'd hope you might take me back inside
When the time is right
Loved ones back home all crying 'cause they're already missing me
I pray by the grace of God that there's somebody listening
Give me a chance to be that person I wanna be (I am unbroken, I'm choking on this ecstasy)
Oh Lord, I'll try so hard, but you gotta let go of me
(Unbreak me, unchain me, I need another chance to live)
:)
